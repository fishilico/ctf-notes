CTF notes
=========

This repository holds some notes and write-ups about IT security challenges and capture-the-flag (CTF) contests.

The main aim of this project is to share interesting issues that can be encountering when analyzing buggy software, network traces, wireless signals, etc.
It contains some scripts and notes that I wrote for some occasions that are probably quite uncommon: I do not expect to reuse the content here again, but who knows? Maybe a similar problem will occur again, for me or someone else who will find this repository...
