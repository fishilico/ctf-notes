Hey, I just found out this piece of code on a server. It must have been used for super important message ciphering but it does not look that strong.
I also recovered a plaintext and its cipher when dumping the RAM :
plaintext : 57 68 6f 20 49 73 20 52 69 6a 6e 64 61 65 6c 20
ciphertext : 4b 95 f3 2b d1 9c ca 0a 81 64 9c 13 05 5d c9 f2
Can you help me by recovering the key ?
